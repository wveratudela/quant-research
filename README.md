# Quant Research

A growing collection of quantitative finance research projects built from scratch in Python.

I am a PhD researcher in mechanical engineering, repositioning my skills into quantitative finance. This repository documents that journey — starting from first principles and progressively building more sophisticated tools and strategies. Each project is self-contained, fully documented, and includes a critical analysis of results, not just the wins.

This is a work in progress. Projects will be added regularly as the research develops.

## Background & Motivation

My background is in numerical modelling, optimisation, and scientific computing (Python, C++, MATLAB). Quantitative finance is a natural extension of those skills into a domain I find genuinely compelling — markets are complex systems with noisy signals, and the challenge of extracting meaning from that noise is exactly the kind of problem I enjoy.

The goal of this repo is not to find a magic strategy. It is to build rigorous, honest research habits: test on real data, measure the right things, understand *why* something works, and be equally curious about the failures.

## Key Findings Summary

### Q1 — Momentum Backtester (AAPL, 10 years)

A MA20/MA50 crossover strategy tested on AAPL over 10 years, compared against buy-and-hold AAPL and the S&P 500 (SPY).

| Metric | Buy/Sell | Buy & Hold AAPL | Buy & Hold SPY |
|--------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Total Return | 327% | 951% | 246% |
| Sharpe Ratio | 0.53 | 0.68 | 0.47 |
| Max Drawdown | -28.9% | -38.7% | -34.1% |
| CAGR | ~15.7% | ~26.5% | ~13.3% |

**Main takeaway:** The Buy/Sell strategy significantly underperforms buy-and-hold AAPL in bull markets but offers meaningful drawdown protection during crisis periods (e.g. 2020). It functions as a bear market defence mechanism rather than a return maximiser. Survivorship bias, transaction costs, and lookahead bias are acknowledged limitations.

### Q2 — Pairs Trading (Visa & Mastercard, 10 years)

A market-neutral pairs trading strategy on V/MA, tested over 10 years, compared against buy-and-hold V, MA, and SPY.

| Metric | Pairs V/MA | Buy & Hold V | Buy & Hold MA | Buy & Hold SPY |
|--------|------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Total Return | 58% | 345% | 492% | 242% |
| Sharpe Ratio | 0.13 | 0.45 | 0.52 | 0.46 |
| Max Drawdown | -2.1% | -36.4% | -41.0% | -34.1% |
| CAGR | 4.7% | 16.1% | 19.5% | 13.1% |

**Main takeaway:** The pairs strategy delivers modest absolute returns but with a near-zero maximum drawdown of -2.1% — roughly 17x better capital preservation than buy-and-hold alternatives. The 2020 crash that wiped 30-40% from all other strategies left the pairs portfolio virtually untouched. The strategy is not a return maximiser — it is a capital preservation tool, most valuable to risk-averse investors or as a market-neutral complement to a directional portfolio. In a leveraged institutional context, the stable low-volatility returns become commercially significant.

### Q3 — Portfolio Optimisation (Magnificent 7, 5 years)

Markowitz mean-variance optimisation and Black-Litterman model applied to the Magnificent 7, compared against equal-weight allocation and SPY.

| Portfolio | Final Value ($10k start) | Volatility | Sharpe |
|-----------|--------------------------|------------|--------|
| Equal Weight | ~$40,000 | 29.9% | 1.07 |
| Target Return Optimised | ~$45,000 | 26.6% | — |
| Minimum Variance | ~$21,000 | 23.7% | — |
| Max Sharpe (100% NVDA) | ~$153,000 | 51.8% | 1.80 |
| Black-Litterman | ~$49,000 | 26.6% | - |
| SPY benchmark | ~$17,000 | — | - |

**Main takeaway:** Markowitz optimisation successfully reduces portfolio volatility by 11.2% while maintaining equal-weight returns — but the unconstrained Sharpe maximisation degenerates to 100% NVDA, exposing the critical weakness of mean-variance optimisation: estimation error. Raw historical returns are a poor proxy for future expectations. Black-Litterman addresses this by anchoring to market equilibrium returns and blending in investor views with explicit confidence levels, producing more diversified and robust portfolios. The most counterintuitive finding: META appeared in nearly every optimised portfolio despite subjective underperformance, because its low correlation with other assets provides a genuine diversification benefit that the optimizer refuses to discard.
